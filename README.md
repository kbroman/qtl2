[R/qtl2](https://kbroman.org/qtl2/) (aka qtl2) is a reimplementation of
the QTL analysis software [R/qtl](https://rqtl.org), to better handle
high-dimensional data and complex cross designs.

Also see the related packages,
[qtl2convert](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2convert) (for converting
data among the R/qtl2, DOQTL, and R/qtl formats)
and [qtl2fst](https://github.com/rqtl/qtl2fst) (for storing genotype
probabilities on disk).

### Installation

Install R/qtl2 from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org):

    install.packages("qtl2")
